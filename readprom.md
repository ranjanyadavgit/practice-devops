You've provided the output of a kubectl describe command for a Kubernetes resource. Based on the "Name" and "Selector" fields, this output describes a Prometheus instance managed by the Prometheus Operator, likely deployed as part of the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart.

Let's break down the key parts of this output:

1. General Information:

Name: prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus: This is the full name of the Prometheus resource. It's quite long, typical for resources deployed by Helm charts and operators, following a pattern like <release-name>-<chart-name>-<component>.

Namespace: default: The Prometheus instance is deployed in the default namespace.

CreationTimestamp: Tue, 11 Jun 2025 19:07:55 +0530: This indicates when the Prometheus instance was created. (Note: The year 2025 is in the future relative to our current knowledge base, but this is just a timestamp from your output).

Selector: These are the labels used by this Prometheus resource to identify and manage its associated Pods. Any Pod with all these labels will be managed by this Prometheus instance.

app.kubernetes.io/instance=prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus
app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=prometheus-operator
app.kubernetes.io/name=prometheus
operator.prometheus.io/name=prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus
operator.prometheus.io/shard=1
prometheus=prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus
Labels: These are labels applied to the Prometheus resource itself, indicating its origin and purpose. They provide metadata for organization and selection.

app=kube-prometheus-stack-prometheus
app.kubernetes.io/instance=prometheus
app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=Helm
app.kubernetes.io/part-of=kube-prometheus-stack (Confirms it's part of this popular monitoring stack)
app.kubernetes.io/version=74.2.0 (Version of the kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart)
chart=kube-prometheus-stack-72.2.0
heritage=Helm (Indicates it was deployed by Helm)
managed-by=prometheus-operator (Crucial: Shows it's managed by the Prometheus Operator, which handles its lifecycle, configuration, etc.)
operator.prometheus.io/mode=server
operator.prometheus.io/name=prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus
operator.prometheus.io/shard=1 (Indicates this might be part of a sharded Prometheus setup, though only one replica is currently running).
Annotations: Additional metadata, often used by tools like Helm (meta.helm.sh/release-name) or the Prometheus Operator (prometheus-operator-input-hash).

2. State and Strategy:

Replicas: 2 desired | 1 total: This is an important detail. It says that the desired number of Prometheus replicas is 2, but currently, only 1 is running. This indicates a potential issue where one Prometheus pod failed to start or is stuck. You'd typically want both desired replicas to be running for high availability.
Update Strategy: RollingUpdate: This is the default update strategy for most Kubernetes controllers. When you update the Prometheus configuration, the operator will gracefully replace old pods with new ones, ensuring continuous service.
Pods Status: 2 Running / 0 Waiting / 0 Succeeded / 0 Failed: This contradicts the "Replicas" line. It says 2 Running. This might be a transient state where kubectl describe caught it while the second replica was just spinning up or a discrepancy in output. Given 2 desired | 1 total and 2 Running, it implies that at the moment of kubectl describe, it identified two running pods. If the "Replicas" line updates slowly, this might be the case. If this 1 total remains for a long time while 2 Running is reported, it suggests a potential inconsistency or problem in the operator's reconciliation.
3. Pod Template:

This section describes the blueprint for the Prometheus Pods that the operator will create.

Labels: These labels will be applied to the individual Prometheus Pods. They are used by services and network policies to identify these pods.
Annotations: kubectl.kubernetes.io/default-container: prometheus means that prometheus is considered the primary container for kubectl logs and kubectl exec commands if not specified.
Service Account: prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus: The Prometheus Pods will run with this service account, which dictates the permissions they have within the Kubernetes API (e.g., to discover targets, create alerts).
4. Init Containers:

init-config-reloader: This container runs before the main Prometheus container. Its purpose is to:
Listen on port 8081.
Reload the Prometheus configuration. It likely takes a compressed configuration file (prometheus.yaml.gz), uncompresses it, performs environment variable substitution (--config-envsubst-file), and outputs it to /etc/prometheus/config_out/prometheus.env.yaml.
This ensures that Prometheus starts with the correct, processed configuration, including rules.
It also watches a directory (--watched-dir) for rule files, implying it helps with dynamically updating rule sets.
5. Containers:

prometheus: This is the main Prometheus server container.

Image: quay.io/prometheus/prometheus:v3.4.1: Specifies the Prometheus image and version being used.
Port: 9090/TCP: The default port Prometheus listens on for its web UI and scraping endpoints.
Args: These are command-line arguments passed to the Prometheus executable:
--config.file=/etc/prometheus/config_out/prometheus.env.yaml: Tells Prometheus to load its configuration from the file prepared by the init-config-reloader and config-reloader.
--web.enable-lifecycle: Enables the /reload endpoint, which the config-reloader uses to trigger a configuration reload without restarting Prometheus.
--web.external-url: Defines the URL under which Prometheus is externally reachable (important for UI links).
--web.route-prefix=/: Sets the URL path prefix.
--storage.tsdb.retention.time=10d: Configures data retention for the time series database (TSDB) to 10 days. Older data will be purged.
--storage.tsdb.path=/prometheus: Specifies where Prometheus stores its time series data.
--storage.tsdb.wal-compression: Enables compression for the write-ahead log (WAL), saving disk space.
--web.config.file: Specifies a separate web configuration file, potentially for TLS or authentication.
Probes (Liveness, Readiness, Startup): These define how Kubernetes monitors the health of the Prometheus container.
http-get http://:http-web/-/healthy: Liveness probe checks if Prometheus is still alive. If it fails too many times, the container will be restarted.
http-get http://:http-web/-/ready: Readiness probe checks if Prometheus is ready to serve traffic. If not ready, traffic won't be routed to it.
http-get http://:http-web/-/ready: Startup probe checks if Prometheus has started successfully. This is useful for applications that take a long time to start up, allowing the other probes to wait until startup is complete.
Mounts: List of volumes mounted into the container (explained below).
config-reloader: This sidecar container runs alongside the main Prometheus container.

Image: quay.io/prometheus-operator/prometheus-config-reloader:v0.82.2: Same image as the init container.
Port: 8080/TCP.
Args:
--listen-address=:8080: Listens for signals to reload.
--reload-url=http://127.0.0.1:9090/-/reload: This is critical. When the config-reloader detects changes in configuration or rule files, it sends an HTTP POST request to this URL (the Prometheus /-/reload endpoint) to tell the main Prometheus container to reload its configuration without restarting the Prometheus process. This allows for dynamic updates.
--config-file, --config-envsubst-file, --watched-dir: Similar to the init container, it monitors configuration and rule files for changes.
Mounts: Shares volumes with the Prometheus container to access config and rules.
6. Volumes:

These define the storage mechanisms used by the Pods:

config: A Secret named prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus is mounted, containing the Prometheus configuration.
tls-assets: A Projected volume that injects TLS assets (certificates/keys) from a Secret for secure communication if enabled.
config-out: An EmptyDir volume with Medium: Memory. This is a temporary volume stored in RAM, used by the init-config-reloader and config-reloader to write the processed Prometheus configuration before it's read by the main Prometheus container. This ensures that sensitive configurations are not persisted to disk.
prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus-rulefiles-0: A ConfigMap that holds Prometheus recording rules and alerting rules.
web-config: Another Secret providing specific web configurations for Prometheus, likely related to authentication or TLS.
prometheus-prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus-db: An EmptyDir volume. This is where Prometheus stores its time series database (TSDB). Important Note: An EmptyDir volume means that data stored here is lost if the pod restarts or moves to another node. For a production Prometheus instance, you would almost certainly want a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) here instead, so that Prometheus data persists across pod restarts and rescheduling. The fact that it's an EmptyDir suggests this might be a development or transient setup, or perhaps a very specific use case where data persistence for Prometheus itself isn't a primary concern (e.g., if you're sending all data to a long-term storage like Thanos or Mimir).
7. Node-Selectors and Tolerations:

Node-Selectors: <none>: No specific node labels are being used to restrict where these pods can run.
Tolerations: <none>: No taints are being tolerated, meaning these pods won't run on tainted nodes unless a default toleration is already present (which is rare).
8. Volume Claims: <none>: This confirms that no PersistentVolumeClaims are explicitly declared directly in the Prometheus resource, reinforcing the use of EmptyDir for the database.

In summary:

This output describes a Prometheus instance deployed in Kubernetes using the Prometheus Operator and likely the kube-prometheus-stack. It's configured with a main Prometheus container, an init container to prepare its configuration, and a sidecar container to dynamically reload its configuration when changes occur. The Prometheus instance is set for 2 replicas but only 1 is currently running (or was running at the time of the describe command). A notable point is the use of EmptyDir for the Prometheus database, which means data persistence for Prometheus itself is not guaranteed if the pod moves or restarts.
